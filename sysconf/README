This dir consists of the sys config files in my box( Debian stable,
testing,and unstable,Gentoo, Mageia, FreeBSD and NetBSD).
I dont want to keep all the config file same in different box, 'cause 
that's useless and make no sense.

I dont mean to keep my home dir as a git repos, but cp the config files
from my home dir and remove the *.* prefix if possible.

The list of the config would be listed here:
vimrc
vim
